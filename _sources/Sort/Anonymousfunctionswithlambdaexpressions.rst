Anonymous functions with lambda expressions
-------------------------------------------

To further drive home the idea that we are passing a function object as a parameter to the sorted object, 
let's see an alternative notation for creating a function, a **lambda expression**. The syntax of a lambda 
expression is the word "lambda" followed by parameter names, separated by commas but not inside (parentheses), 
followed by a colon and then an expression. ``lambda arguments: expression`` yields a function object. This 
unnamed object behaves just like the function object constructed below. 

.. sourcecode:: python

    def fname(arguments):
        return expression
        
.. image:: Figures/lambda.gif
   :alt: image showing how elements of a lambda expression are like a function definition.

Consider the following code

.. activecode:: sort_7

    def f(x):
        return x - 1
    
    print(f)
    print(type(f))
    print(f(3))
    
    print(lambda x: x-2)
    print(type(lambda x: x-2))
    print((lambda x: x-2)(6))
    
Note the paralells between the two. At line 4, f is bound to a function object. Its printed representation
is "<function f>". At line 8, the lambda expression produces a function object. Because it is unnamed (anonymous), 
its printed representation doesn't include a name for it, "<function <lambda>>". Both are of type 'function'.

A function, whether named or anonymous, can be called by placing parentheses () after it.
In this case, because there is one parameter, there is one value in parentheses. This
works the same way for the named function and the anonymous function produced by the lambda
expression. The lambda expression had to go in parentheses just for the purposes
of grouping all its contents together. Without the extra parentheses around it on line 10, 
the interpreter would group things differently and make a function of x that returns x - 2(6).

Some students find it more natural to work with lambda expressions than to refer to a function
by name. Others find the syntax of lambda expressions confusing. It's up to you which version you want to 
use though you will need to be able to read and understand lambda expressions that are written by others. 
In all the examples below, both ways of doing it will be illustrated.

Below, sorting on absolute value has been rewritten using lambda notation and the built-in function abs.

.. activecode:: sort_8

    L1 = [1, 7, 4, -2, 3]
    
    print("About to call sorted")
    L2 = sorted(L1, key=lambda x: abs(x))
    print("Finished execution of sorted")
    print(L2)

Of course, it's unnecessary to make an anonymous function that takes an input and just calls an existing function on it. That's equivalent to just providing the existing function as a lambda expression. You may find, however, that the lambda expression above helps you understand what sorted does with the function that is passed in: it calls the function on each of the items in the list that is passed to sorted. Make sure you understand why the code above and the code immediately below cause the list to be sorted the same way. 

.. activecode:: sort_8a  

    L1 = [1, 7, 4, -2, 3]
    
    print("About to call sorted")
    L2 = sorted(L1, key=abs)
    print("Finished execution of sorted")
    print(L2)


.. mchoice:: test_questionsort_1
   :answer_a: descending order, from 7 down to -2
   :answer_b: ascending order, from -2 up to 7
   :answer_c: the original order of L1
   :feedback_a: 7 is decorated with -7, so it is first; -2 is decorated with 2, so it is last.
   :feedback_b: -x produces the negative of x.
   :feedback_c: sorted changes the order.
   :correct: a
   :practice: T
   :topics: Sort/Anonymousfunctionswithlambdaexpressions

   Describe what the sort order will be for this.
   
   .. code-block:: python 

    L1 = [1, 7, 4, -2, 3]
     
    print(sorted(L1, key = lambda x: -x))

.. mchoice:: test_questionsort_2
   :answer_a: descending order, from 7 down to -2
   :answer_b: ascending order, from -2 up to 7
   :answer_c: the original order of L1
   :feedback_a: The True value for the reverse parameter says to reverse the order.
   :feedback_b: The True value for the reverse parameter says to reverse the order.
   :feedback_c: sorted changes the order.
   :correct: b
   :practice: T
   :topics: Sort/Anonymousfunctionswithlambdaexpressions

   Describe what the sort order will be for this.
   
   .. code-block:: python 

    L1 = [1, 7, 4, -2, 3]
     
    print(sorted(L1, key = lambda x: -x, reverse = True))
